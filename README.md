# Portfolio-Site
Developed a personal portfolio page using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework according to the [Udacity Frontend nanodegree Styles Guide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/index.html)

The page is fully responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and desktop browsers.

The set of all the files gives the visual result of my [Portfolio](https://colorscodex.github.io/Portfolio-Site/portfolio-english.html), where you can see not only my curriculum but also the projects for the Front End Nanodegree course through [Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/).
